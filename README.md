# Komunify

**One subscription. Every community.** Komunify is a consumer payments dApp on Stellar: members pay one subscription to unlock benefits across partner communities, a Soroban contract auto-splits the revenue between platform, project owner, and community manager, and an on-chain dashboard proves the traction.

> Status: building. Started at Build on Stellar Bootcamp Bandung (July 4-5, 2026) as "Communify", a community-pool concept; refined into Komunify (PRD v2.0) for the APAC Stellar Hackathon.
>
> **Live demo:** https://komunify.pages.dev (Stellar testnet; bring a Freighter/xBull/Albedo wallet set to Testnet)
> **Clickable prototype (simulated data):** https://komunify-prototype.pages.dev

**Track:** Payment Consumer Applications

## Problem

Community members juggle separate subscriptions and memberships across every community they join, so payment friction piles up and the value of belonging gets hard to see. On the other side, community managers and project owners have no simple way to monetize their resources, share partner revenue transparently, or show verifiable traction. Indonesia especially runs on community finance culture (koperasi, patungan, kas komunitas), but the money flows live in notebooks and chat groups: opaque, manual, unverifiable.

## Why Stellar

- **Transactions cost near zero and settle in seconds**, so consumer-scale subscription payments stay economical.
- **Soroban adds programmable payout logic**: subscription records, entitlements, and automated revenue splits run on-chain instead of in a spreadsheet.
- **Anchors bridge rupiah to the network**, so members can think in IDR, not crypto.
- **Asset issuance and a DEX are built into the protocol**, so tokenized partner items and benefits need no custom infrastructure.

## Target Users

1. **Community members** who want one payment flow for bundled perks, premium resources, and discounts across the communities they already belong to.
2. **Community managers** who want to package benefits and receive automated revenue share without manual reconciliation.
3. **Project owners** who want partner-led growth with transparent payout logic and on-chain proof of engagement.

## Proposed Solution

One subscription on Soroban:

1. A member connects a Stellar wallet and pays one subscription on testnet.
2. The contract records the subscription and activates the member's entitlement.
3. The same payment triggers an automated revenue split between platform, project owner, and community manager.
4. Partner benefits (including tokenized items at subscriber discounts) unlock in the member dashboard.
5. A traction dashboard reads subscriber count, payment volume, and payout events straight from the chain.

## Core Features (MVP)

- Unified subscription with multi-benefit access (wallet connect + one testnet payment)
- Automated fee and reward disbursement (Soroban split contract)
- Tokenized digital listing layer (one or two partner items, subscriber pricing)
- On-chain traction dashboard (subscribers, volume, payouts, via Horizon)

## North Star Metric

**Monthly Active Subscribing Members (MASM)** engaging with at least one community benefit or marketplace transaction, reflecting the core value loop: unified access driving real usage and recurring revenue.

Supporting metrics: active community partners onboarded, subscription renewal rate, GMV of tokenized items sold, total automated disbursement volume on-chain.

## What's in this repo now (Levels 1 + 2 complete)

A working end-to-end slice of the product, live at https://komunify.pages.dev on Stellar testnet:

- **Subscribe with on-chain split:** pay one subscription and the Soroban contract splits it 70/20/10 to owner / manager / platform in the same transaction, with pending / success / fail status and the tx hash linked to Stellar Expert
- **Live traction dashboard:** subscriber count, payment volume, and payout split to date, read straight from the contract
- **Desktop-first UI** on the SPLIT v4 design system (1080px shell, topbar, stepper, split-flow visual), single-column under 900px

- Connect and disconnect any major Stellar wallet (Freighter, xBull, Albedo, Lobstr, Hana, and more) via a wallet-selection modal
- Fetch and display the connected wallet's XLM balance
- Fund an unactivated account via Friendbot with one click
- Send an XLM payment on testnet with clear feedback: pending, success with transaction hash (linked to Stellar Expert), or failure state

**Tech stack:** React + Vite · Stellar Wallets Kit (multi-wallet) · `@stellar/stellar-sdk` (Horizon testnet)

## Setup (run locally)

1. Install [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org) and a Stellar wallet (e.g. [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/), xBull, or Albedo)
2. Set your wallet's network to **Testnet**
3. Clone and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoms07/stellar-hackathon.git
cd stellar-hackathon/packages/dapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Open the printed localhost URL, connect a wallet, fund with Friendbot if needed, and subscribe with testnet XLM

(Or from the repo root with [bun](https://bun.sh): `bun install && bun run dev` runs every package in parallel.)

## Smart Contract: Komunify (Soroban)

The subscription + revenue-split contract, in [`contracts/contracts/komunify/src/lib.rs`](contracts/contracts/komunify/src/lib.rs). One payment in, three transfers out, everything recorded and queryable on-chain:

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `subscribe(member, amount)` | Take a subscription payment and split it on-chain to owner / manager / platform (basis points set at deploy; rounding dust goes to platform so the cuts always sum exactly) |
| `get_subscribers()` | Every subscription recorded (member, amount, timestamp) |
| `get_count()` | Number of subscriptions |
| `get_volume()` | Total volume paid through the contract |
| `get_config()` | Payout addresses + split percentages, read by the dapp's live stats card |

Guards: minimum 1 XLM (`AmountTooLow`), split must sum to 100% (`InvalidSplit`, enforced in the constructor), payments move through the Stellar Asset Contract with `require_auth` on the member. Four unit tests cover the split math, rounding, minimum, and constructor validation:

```bash
cd contracts
cargo test -p komunify   # 4 passed
stellar contract build   # target/wasm32v1-none/release/komunify.wasm
```

**Live on testnet:**

- **Contract ID:** [`CCEKCVWLONZGJEMROPXQ6OAFQTNJIIOJCWSAR6O3TUSSOQT76EC6PL4X`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCEKCVWLONZGJEMROPXQ6OAFQTNJIIOJCWSAR6O3TUSSOQT76EC6PL4X)
- **Verified `subscribe` call:** [`1e207d18…46b3`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/1e207d189037cd4f67401e125fcd033a39bddc2bbc28833ed527ff09fc2046b3) — 10 XLM in, split 7 / 2 / 1 XLM to the three payout addresses in one transaction
- Split config on this deploy: 70% owner · 20% manager · 10% platform (placeholder economics, set via constructor args)
- Also invocable on [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org) → Smart contracts → Contract explorer

The Day 1 bootcamp contribution-ledger contract this evolved from lives in the git history (`contract/` before 2026-07-05).

## Architecture

```
stellar-hackathon/
  contracts/contracts/komunify/   Soroban contract (Rust): subscribe + split + reads, 4 unit tests
  packages/dapp/                  React + Vite dapp (the live demo): wallet, subscribe, traction
  packages/web/                   Next.js site (scaffold)
  packages/contract-client/       generated TypeScript bindings package
  prototype/                      static clickable prototype, 6 screens (design source of truth with DESIGN.md)
  brand/                          SPLIT v4 brand board
```

Data flow: the browser connects a wallet through **Stellar Wallets Kit**, builds contract calls with **`contract.Client` from `@stellar/stellar-sdk`** against **Soroban RPC** (`soroban-testnet.stellar.org`), and signs with the wallet. Balances and Friendbot go through **Horizon**. The `subscribe` call moves XLM through the Stellar Asset Contract to the three payout addresses and publishes an event; the traction cards re-read `get_count` / `get_volume` after every confirmed payment. No backend: the chain is the backend.

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** Cloudflare Pages, project `komunify` → https://komunify.pages.dev. Redeploy: `cd packages/dapp && npm run build && npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name komunify`
- **Contract:** `cd contracts && stellar contract build && stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/komunify.wasm --source-account <identity> --network testnet -- --token <XLM SAC> --owner <G...> --manager <G...> --platform <G...> --owner_bps 7000 --manager_bps 2000 --platform_bps 1000`. After a redeploy, update `CONTRACT_ID` in `packages/dapp/src/komunify.js` and republish Pages.
